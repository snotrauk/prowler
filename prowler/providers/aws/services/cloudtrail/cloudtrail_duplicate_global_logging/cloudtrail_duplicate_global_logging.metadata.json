  "Description": "The account under review contains multiple Trails with global service logging enabled. While this does not jeopardize the security of the environment, duplicated entries in logs increase the difficulty to investigate potential incidents.\nFor most services, events are recorded in the region where the action occurred. For global services such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS STS, and Amazon CloudFront, events are delivered to any trail that includes global services.\nFor most global services, events are logged as occurring in US East (N. Virginia) Region, but some global service events are logged as occurring in other regions, such as US East (Ohio) Region or US West (Oregon) Region.\nTo avoid receiving duplicate global service events, remember the following:\n- Global service events are delivered by default to trails that are created using the CloudTrail console. Events are delivered to the bucket for the trail.\n- If you have multiple single region trails, consider configuring your trails so that global service events are delivered in only one of the trails. For more information, see Enabling and disabling logging global service events.\n- If you change the configuration of a trail from logging all regions to logging a single region, global service event logging is turned off automatically for that trail. Similarly, if you change the configuration of a trail from logging a single region to logging all regions, global service event logging is turned on automatically for that trail.",
